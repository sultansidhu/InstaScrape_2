# InstaScrape_2
This program uses selenium and bs4 in python to access instagram profiles and parse data from them. The parsed data is then stored in SQLite databases and displayed. The profile picture is also parsed and stored in computer memory, the path to it is also added to the database. 

This program requires the initiation of a directory called parsed_dps in the location where you will be storing this program. The display pictures of the accessed profiles will be put into the above mentioned directory.
